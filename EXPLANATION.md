I already know C/C++ so i will tell as short as possible.

In Assignment 1 This showed me how dereferencing works.

In Assignment 2 This taught me how a pointer can move step by step through memory.

In Assignment 3 This showed me that pointers allow functions to change data outside their own scope.

In Assignment 4  This showed me that a double pointer is like a chain of references.

In Assignment 5 This helped me how pointers can work with text .
